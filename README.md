Process of creation:

I first made the program arrayRando which simply randomises an inputted array
Then I recreated the program using a function
then i made a program to check if an array is sorted or not
finally i used all this to create bogoSort

this is a simple concept:


if(Array is sorted){
  great, no need to do anything
}
else{
  randomise the array
}


this program is more of a joke sorting algorythim as it is increadibly inifecint
